- [imgdata]() Data preprocessing scripts used in this thesis, Since the food materials datasets are already used for business, if you need these datasets, please let us know and can be obtained by emailing winc.wu@gmail.com.
- [netconfig]() bash scripts used to train the scripts on a bash environment

We made use of the deep learning framework [BVLC/Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), The caffe installation tutorial can see https://github.com/Winckwu/Caffe-GPU-ubuntu16.04-install
